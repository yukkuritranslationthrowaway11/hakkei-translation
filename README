Translated dialogues for the Yukkuri Hakkei game.

Developer's site: http://ennjiiro.seesaa.net/

Drop the content of the `translated' folder inside the game's `text'
folder, then run the executable which updates the dialogues.

The `original' folder is used to track changes between different
versions.  When a new version is out, drop the content of the `text'
folder inside `original' and let Git do its magic.
