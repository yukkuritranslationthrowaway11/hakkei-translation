The 'translated' folder contains a set of directories containing the
dialogues of the latest version.  To update the in-game dialogues,
copy those directories inside the game's 'text' folder.  After that,
run the executable that is not the game (should be called
'セリフ再読込用.exe'.  If you don't have a program with that name,
just pick the executable that is not the actual game).
After that step, the translations will be applied to the game.

The 'original' folder is used to track changes between different
versions.  When a new version is out, drop the content of the 'text'
folder inside 'original' and let Git do its magic ('git add' the
files, then use 'git diff' to check what was changed).

The howto.txt file inside the translated 'event' folder, which can
also be found as イベント改変について.txt in the original 'event'
folder, may not actually be a how-to guide, but perhaps a guide on
what to edit if you want to mess around with debug settings.
