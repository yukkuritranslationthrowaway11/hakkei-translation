The 'translated' folders contain a set of directories containing the
dialogues of their respective versions.  To update the in-game dialogues,
copy those directories inside the game's 'text' folder.  After that,
run the executable that is not the game (should be called
'セリフ再読込用.exe'.  If you don't have a program with that name,
just pick the executable that is not the actual game).
After that step, the translations will be applied to the game.

The 'original' folder was used to track changes between different
versions.  When a new version was out, one was to drop the content 
of the 'text' folder inside 'original' and let Git do its magic 
('git add' the files, then use 'git diff' to check what was changed). 
However, the latest version as of now, 1.11, is also the paid version.
Those who only have the demo version should still be able to play in
a language they understand, so there are now two sets of folders: one
for the latest version of the game and one for the demo version.

The add.txt file left outside of any of the translated copies can be found in the game directory/pict/add1/add.txt. Since add.txt is not included in the game directory/text folder, it is not in the 'translated' folders either, since their contents are meant to be copy/pasted into the game directory/text folder. However, the add.txt file may be useful to modders, so it is still included in the git.
