Translated dialogues for the Yukkuri Hakkei game.

The `translated' folder contains a set of directories containing the
dialogues of the latest version.  To update the in-game dialogues,
copy those directories inside the game's `text' folder.  After that,
run the executable that is not the game (should be called
'セリフ再読込用.exe'.  If you don't have a program with that name,
just pick the executable that is not the actual game.)
After that step, the game will be translated (to the extent the
translators could.)

The `original' folder is used to track changes between different
versions.  When a new version is out, drop the content of the `text'
folder inside `original' and let Git do its magic ('git add' the
files, then use 'git diff' to check what was changed.)
