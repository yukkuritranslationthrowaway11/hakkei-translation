Each song text file has variants for different yukkuris to sing. The file expects the first 10 lines to be koMarisa's variant, the next 10 to be (adult) Marisa's, the next 10 to be koReimu's, and so forth.

This is the full order.

koMarisa
Marisa
koReimu
Reimu
koMarisa (shell)
Shell Marisa
koReimu (wasa)
Wasa Reimu
koAlice
Alice
koAdd1
Add1

Each variant must take up 10 lines, no more, no less. However, it is still possible to make songs that are shorter than that. After the last lyric line, begin a new line and put the digit 0 in it. Continue creating new line breaks so that there are still 10 lines. Here is an example of such a song, with line numbers added on the side for demonstration purposes.

(1) Easy days
(2) Refreshing days
(3) Yuyuyu
(4) Yuwaaaa
(5) 0
(6)
(7)
(8)
(9)
(10)

If this song was koReimu's variant, the next line is where (adult) Reimu's variant begins.

Please note that this game seems to prefer CRLF (Carriage Return, Line Feed) over LF (Line Feed) newlines. It also seems to use Shift_JIS encoding.
