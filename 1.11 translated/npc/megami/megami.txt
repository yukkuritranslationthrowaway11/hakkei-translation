I am the yukkuri goddess! Prostrate before me!
Feel a goddess' will!
I may use hiragana frequently, but I also understand kanji perfectly.
I am able to do many things, but I simply do not do them.

Aren't you forgetting an offering?










Bring a yukkuri!
Worship me!

Make an offering before returning home!
Eh! Praise me a little more!



When I eat sweets, my power builds up!
Make an offering! Make it at once!
I shall display my power!
This yukkuri shall have a long life!
My power shall return this broken mind to its original state!
