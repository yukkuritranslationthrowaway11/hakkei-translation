//虐待器具
Hand drill.\nやや値が張る分、耐熱性に優れた加工がしてあるぞ.\n後は...言わなくても分かるな?
Hammer.\n間違って手を打たないように注意したまえ.
Metal box.\nIf you want to scare a yukkuri without injuring them, you can\nhammer on the box with a yukkuri inside it.
Vibrator.\nArouses the yukkuri after a bit of contact with its skin.\nUseful if you want to expose its peni-peni.
Viyugra contract.\nA drug that arouses yukkuri upon consumption.\nPay-per-use.
Alcohol lamp.\nIt uses a special alcohol so it's only hot enough to burn a\nyukkuri and its accessories. Safe for humans!
Seat + Elastic of Punishment.\nThe elastic is for securing the yukkuri to the seat. Lying it\non its back leaves its mister hips and anyaru open for abyuse!
Nyutering kit.\nCut off a yukkuri's peni-peni. The peni-peni has to be\nexposed first, so I recommend a vibrator or viyugra.
Stalk shears.\n特殊な形状で、切断と同時に切断面を圧着することで出餡を防ぐぞ.\n虐待目的でも、狙い以外での事故は避けたいからな...
Razor.\nYukkuri hair is mostly sugar, so human razors aren't ideal.\nCareful, a shaved yukkuri might have a mental breakdown!
Ramune spray contract.\nPuts yukkuri to sleep immediately, like hand-fed ramune,\nbut without letting them taste the sweetness of ramune.
Anti-antiyukkuritis contract.\nA drug that prevents antiyukkuritis in a yukkuri for 1 day.\nFreezing a yukkuri also deactivates the drug. Pay-per-use.
