Apologies, I'm not dealing with badged yukkuri right now.
Truth is, the breeder that worked on this has retired...
There's a lack of breeders, and a small shop like mine\ncan't afford a partnership.
What? You have a breeder certificate!?
If you don't mind, will you sell your yukkuri here to make it a mother?\nEven bronze badges are fine.
By all means, thank you very much.
Waa! It's a bronze badge!
It's amazing you have one so early!
This yukkuri will start a new lineage! Please support me!

...
...! ...!
...Recently, the yukkuri market is focusing on yukkuri with \nhigh grade badges, so that there is no need for training.
Within the neighborhood, where yukkuri shops are more about the livelihood than breeding,\nby dealing with nothing but bronze badges you can only meet difficulties.
Wouldn't it benefit both parties if you were to sell the shop?
I refuse!
What about management improvements?\n...if this shop were to disappear,\nwouldn't that trouble all the yukkuri owners of the area?
Well...
...
Oh, that's it!!\nThis breeder will provide you with a gold badged yukkuri！！
...
That was rude of me.\nI thought I knew the face of a prominent breeder in the neighborhood、\nbut I didn't remember it ...
Oh, fine!!\nI'll have a talk with the breeder right now、so please pick it up!!
...
I understand. I'm sorry for today、\nPlease call me anytime if you change your mind.
...
I just showed you something unsightly、\nI apologize for saying something weird...
Oh, but if I don't say it、I'm not going to come back ...
I'm trying to enter the new market、\nIt seems to be the owner of a another yukkuri shop、\nbut I was told to sell the shop...
I tried to refuse、\nI felt that way was right、\nand I came to a place to where I was panicking.
So...
I would like you to become the owner of a high rank badged yukkuri.\nWhat..
No？
Eh？You'll do it!？\nThank you!!
First of all, you can go to the silver badge class, so please!

Welcome
Thank you for hearing the impossible request the other day.\nIt's good for the bronze badges, and it's been taken care of ...
I also studied a lot so that I could rebuild the shop alone、\nI made a supplement that would support health and growth of your yukkuri.
Based on the ingredients of high-grade sweets、It will provide the nutrients essential for the growth of yukkuri\nwith a diffrent approach from food.
We will keep it cheap, so please try using it!

Wow! This is a silver badge!
It's amazing you have one so fast!
This Yukkuri will start a new lineage！ Please support me!
