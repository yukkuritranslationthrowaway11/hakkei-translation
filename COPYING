The license for files inside the `original' folder isn't exactly clear
at the time of this writing.  As a rule of thumb, never ditribute
those files without also distributing the translated files.  If
possible, place a link to the original author's website
(http://ennjiiro.seesaa.net/) somewhere noticeable.

The translated files are in the public domain where appliable.
