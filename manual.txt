CONTROLS
It's mostly a point-and-click game.
Right-click to deselect an action.
You can click on the scold toggle to... well... toggle it. You can also press
the space bar to toggle it.

SCOLDING
The scold toggle is currently in Japanese. If you see する, the scold toggle is
set to ON. If you instead see しない, it is set to OFF.
If an action is selected and the scold toggle text is white, performing the
action will have a scolding effect if you set the toggle to ON. If the scold
toggle text is gray, regardless of whether the toggle is ON or OFF the action
ill not have a scolding effect.
If no action is selected and the scold toggle is ON, clicking a yukkuri verbally
scolds it.

GAME SPEED
When set to slow, 1 in-game minute passes per real-life second.
When set to normal, 1 in-game minute passes for every 6 real-life seconds.
When set to slow, 1 in-game minute passes when a 1 real-life minute passes.

BACKGROUND PROCESSING
Turning it off may speed up game performance.

TRAINING: READING
If the gauge at the top is not empty, click to make the yukkuri speed up for a
fixed amount of time. When it is empty, clicking will no longer have an effect
on the yukkuri.

TRAINING: ARITHMETIC
Click when the gauge is full (the bar inside will turn yellow) to have the
yukkuri tell you the next number in the sequence. Here's a tip: the gauge is
called "biorhythm" for a reason.

BONUSES
Want your yukkuri to be nicer, smarter, and more affectionate, but faster? Earn
achievements, they boost the effects of your scolding and training, and any
actions you take that would make your yukkuri like you more are more effective.
ou are always able to toggle your earned bonuses on or off, so you can switch
between playing with and without them at your leisure.

WHY ISN'T MY SCUM ALICE RAPING OTHER YUKKURI?
If the Alice is acting like any other aroused yukkuri, just wait. Alice will
eventually face forward with a sad expression, say a line of dialogue, and then
she will attempt rape.

ON CONFISCATING AND REPLACING ACCESSORIES
Hide adult Reimu's accessory. Let's call this Reimu "Reimyu" for ease of
reference. Then, hold a different adult Reimu's accessory. Let's call that
adult Reimu "Reimu." Reimyu will not run after Reimu's accessory. If you try to
manually put Reimu's accessory on Reimyu, the accessory will drop to the ground
as if you were just holding it in the air. Yukkuri recognize their own
accessory, and will not try to steal another yukkuri's accessory, no matter how
stupid and/or scummy they are. The only time you will see multiple yukkuri
pursuing the same accessory is when you have hidden their accessories and
used the menu to put one accessory (of the correct type and age! The situation
mentioned above with Reimyu not reacting whatsoever to Reimu's accessory also
happens if you try to put a koReimu ribbon on an adult Reimu, or a koMarisa hat
on a koAlice. Also, Shell Marisa does not accept regular Marisa accessories and
vice versa).

You cannot use the menu to place more than one koyukkuri accessory and one
adult yukkuri accessory at the same time. So, you can place a koReimu ribbon
and an adult Reimu ribbon, but not a koReimu ribbon and a koMarisa ribbon, or
two koReimu ribbons. You must either put it away (use "Hide accessory") or
wait for an accessoryless yukkuri of the right type and age to put it on.

MISCELLANEOUS INFO
Sometimes, doing an action to one yukkuri will also do it to overlapping
yukkuri, or you end up doing it to a different yukkuri than the intended one.
A potential way around this is clicking the label or number above the yukkuri's
head instead of their sprite.

Autosave saves every 5 minutes.
